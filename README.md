# Config

### Fields/Attributes
* **config**{ Object }:
  * **config.provider** {  _String_ }: Provider used to create proxies as of right now only `digital_ocean` is an option.
  * **config.write_txt** {  _Boolean_ }: Create .txt file with newly created proxies. 
  * **config.digital_ocean.api_key** {  _String_ }: DigitalOcean API Key
  * **config.digital_ocean.ssh_key_id** {  _Number_ }: SSH keys that you wish to embed into your server, you must add your SSH Key to your DigitalOcean account and collect the ID. If you are unsure of the ID associated with your SSH Key you can simply run `node scripts/ssh_keys` to find the ID attached to your key.
  * **config.digital_ocean.region** {  _String_ }: Desired location to deploy proxies. I've gathered together a list of locations you can use [here](https://gist.github.com/dzt/8499a5f3ee0e3fc390891c64f737d3c6)
  * **config.digital_ocean.rsa_id_path** {  _String_ }: The path to your RSA private key, this may vary depending on what operating system you're on by default if you're using `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to generate RSA keys on macOS or Linux then your RSA private key path should look like this `/Users/john/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/home/john/.ssh/id_rsa`. But if you're on Windows, assuming that you're using PuTTYgen to generate your private/public key then you know where the location of you're private key is (usually with the file extension `.ppk`) under the `rsa_id_path` field on Windows yours should look like this `C:\\Users\\Billy\\Documents\\ssh-private.ppk` depending on where you saved your private key.
  * **config.digital_ocean.ssh_passphrase** {  _String_ }: If you did not set a passphrase to your SSH key then you can set this value as `null` otherwise you should set this value to the passphrase if present.
